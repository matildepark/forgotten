# Forgotten

[Forgotten](https://sophiapark.itch.io/forgotten) is a Twine interactive created by [Sophia Park](http://sophiapark.ca), and [Arielle Grimes](http://www.ariellegrimes.com).

# Source code

Includes:

- The Twine 1.4.2 .tws file.
- All audio files contained in a separate folder.
- All images contained in a separate folder.

Please note that the compiled Twine .html references the audio folder. You will require Twine 1.4.2 to open the .tws file; however, there is no required story format, as it uses the default Sugarcane format.

Forgotten uses several Twine macros by other authors:

- The [JavaScript passage transition "Typewriter"](https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/5161) by Leon Arnott.
